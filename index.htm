The system visually supports the flexible event organization as well as the typical usage pattern discovery process. The event organization is innovatively supported through a set of interactive visualizations that allow an analyst to interactively determine how events should be composed and categorized into more meaningful and analysis-relevant units. After organization, usage patterns of these new units can be automatically or manually extracted with the latter views in multiple ways. IntiVisor was evaluated with visualization usages from 5 visualization applications over 4 studies.The studies showed that the system was able to support analysts in discovering a large variety of useful patterns.

These data were then integrated and visualized with the CfD visualization to help the CfD staff make informed, data-driven decisions. The application was deployed and integrated into the center\'s work practice for 2.5 years and provided 3 visualization views. During the deployment, the CfD changed its work practice on collecting and analyzing data because of the availability of the visualizations.

After the features are selected, the system provides a visualization to help iteratively test the location classification performance of the system. The most innovative aspect of this system is its multiview integration of interactive visualization and computational methods (e.g., classifiers) and its application in the indoor localization domain.

The system supports flexible explorations of interval-based events that occur together or within close temporal proximity. One key innovation is that the system allows an analyst to interactively specify a time window around a type of event to visualize its proximal temporal relationships with another type of event. The visualization technique was applied to visualizing social and communicative behaviors in developmental psychology research because it can effectively highlight individual multimodal coordination behaviors (e.g., gaze + speech) and dyadic interactions (e.g., give + take).

The first type of questions prompt participants about their recent symptoms (e.g., In the past 4 weeks, did you ever have times when you passed out even for a short time? N = No Y = Yes/Don\'t know). The second type of questions prompt participants about their knowledge on diabetes (e.g., If you have diabetes, you should not exercise. F=FalseT=True). Text messaging was the communication medium of this study population at the time so the study hoped to leverage adolescents\' familiarity and affinity to this mode of communication to engage them in the intervention. Afterwards, health care providers of the participants can examine the responses through a web-based dashboard. To further facilitate access to this information, the responses can be printed into a one-page visualization for at-a-glance consumption during the participants clinical visits.
